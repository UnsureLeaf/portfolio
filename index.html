    <p>Hello. <br> My name is Hunter Thompson. <br> I am a year one Web Design student. <br> I am hoping to become better at web designing, so that I can help companies and people in the future with their website creation. I am going to college for web design, app creation, and 3D modeling. I was born on September 1st, 2001, and I am 16 years old as of the creation of this portfolio. I have learned a lot thanks to my teacher, Mrs. Sinclair. If she hadn't been around, I would have never been able to learn HTML and CSS the way I have today. </p>
    <p> I was raised in Bartlett, but I have gone to multiple schools. The one I learned the most in was Bartlett High School. In the future, I want to make games as a side project. One of the series I have the most interest in making a game for is my friends and my series of Zenaria. Aside from that, I just want to further my skills in everything I can in hopes of becoming more than just an average person. Below, there is a picture of me and links to several of the websites I have made so far. </p>
